                    A food making machine project. This machine works as a printer except for
                    the paper is slices of bread, and toppings are extruded instead of ink.

                    In this repository you may find the software code for the project, written in Go and C.

                Minitels are French terminals from the 80's, that supported ascii mode over serial link (more).
                One of their use mode was over a serial link (like a VT100 terminal).
            </p>
            <p>
                This project is a curses-like library, compatible with the
                non-extended ascii character set supported by the terminal.
            </p>
            <p>The above shown messenger client was written using this library and the
                <a href="https://github.com/carpedm20/fbchat">fbchat</a> API.</p>

                This is my first attempt at building a bootable program with very basic functionnalities,
                such as a 32b enabling, extended memory addressing, floppy drive reading.
